### Run Locally and Create Your Own Version

If you want to run the project locally on your machine, you can clone the repository and build the entire project by following the steps below. *Make sure you have* `node` *and* `npm` *installed before trying any of the followings.*
```bash
npm install .
npm run start
```
After you see the server up running at `localhost:3000` and `compiled successfully`, you can go to your browser and open `localhost:3000`. **Enjoy!**

Since this is an open-source project, feel free to create your own version from my code or help me develop the above features. You can contact me through GitHub if you meet any problems or have added something exciting.
